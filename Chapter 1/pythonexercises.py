1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.

2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string. 

3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string. Go to the editor
Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String


4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself. Go to the editor
Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'


5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string. Go to the editor
Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
Expected Result : 'xyc abz'

6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged. Go to the editor
Sample String : 'abc'
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'




9. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string. Go to the editor

10. Write a Python program to change a given string to a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged. Go to the editor

11. Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string. Go to the editor


13. Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases. Go to the editor



# python Exercises on Loops

1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). Go to the editor


2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. 
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius


3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. 
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.



5. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it. 


6. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. Go to the editor
Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
Expected Output :
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4



8. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
Note : Use 'continue' statement.
Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

9. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50. Go to the editor
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


10. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz


11. Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j. Go to the editor
Note :
i = 0,1.., m-1
j = 0,1, n-1.

Test Data : Rows = 3, Columns = 4
